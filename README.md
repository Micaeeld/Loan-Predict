# Loan approval analysis and forecasting
This notebook features a quick exploratory analysis and loan approval forecast using a dataset made available in Kaggle. The dataset contains information about loan applicants such as credit history, income, employment, and more.

## Dataset

O conjunto de dados usado nesta análise foi retirado do Kaggle, uma plataforma online de ciência de dados que oferece conjuntos de dados públicos e privados, bem como ferramentas para análise e modelagem de dados. O conjunto de dados específico usado neste projeto pode ser encontrado em https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirzahasnine/loan-data-set.
## Exploratory analysis
Exploratory analysis was performed to better understand the characteristics of loan applicants and to identify patterns and trends in the data. Some of the questions that were explored during the analysis include:

What are the demographic characteristics of applicants?
What is the income distribution of applicants?
Is there any correlation between applicant characteristics and loan approval?
data preparation
Before creating the loan approval prediction model, the data was pre-processed and prepared for training. Some of the data preparation steps include:

- Cleaning of missing data and outliers
- Coding of categorical features
- Data distribution
- Prediction of loan approval

To predict loan approval, a Logistic Regression model was used. The model was trained using applicants' characteristics as independent variables and loan approval as a dependent variable.
The model was evaluated using the accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. The results showed that the model presented an accuracy of 79%.
